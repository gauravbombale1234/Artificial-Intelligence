# Artificial Intelligence Repository

Welcome to the **Artificial Intelligence** repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of resources, projects, and code implementations focused on AI techniques, models, and algorithms. It is organized into key subfolders, covering major AI domains like neural networks and computer vision, along with their corresponding datasets.

## Repository Structure

### 1. **CNN & ANN**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Explore how CNNs are used in image classification, object detection, and other vision-based tasks.
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**: Learn the foundations of neural networks, covering multi-layer perceptrons and activation functions.

### 2. **Computer Vision**
This subfolder contains all aspects of computer vision, including both image and video processing, alongside state-of-the-art models and techniques.

- **Image Processing**:
  - Techniques for filtering, edge detection, transformations, and feature extraction.
  - Includes all fundamental parts: color models, image segmentation, morphological operations, etc.
  
- **Video Processing**:
  - Learn how to analyze and manipulate video data, frame-by-frame processing, motion detection, and more.

- **YOLO Models**:
  - Implementation and training of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for object detection. 
  - YOLOv3 included.

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**:
  - Hands-on examples of GANs for generating realistic images.
  - Covers basics and advanced concepts of GANs including training dynamics, loss functions, and stability.

- **Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs)**:
  - Special subfolder dedicated to DCGAN implementations, focusing on image generation tasks.

### 3. **Datasets**
All datasets used in the models and implementations are organized in each folders, ensuring easy access for training and experimentation. Each dataset folder contains:
- A description of the dataset
- Preprocessing scripts (if applicable)
- Links to the original dataset sources
